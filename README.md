 [**Project**](Projects/Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb)
 
1. Explore and inspect data
2. Manipulate data using pandas and numpy
3. Communicating results [exercise: explore fuel economy data set](fuel_economy.ipynb)_

## Advanced Data Wrangling

1. Introduction to Advanced Data Wrangling 
   
2. Gathering Data
   programmatically unzipping flat files(csv, tsv): read .zip files using `zipfile` and `pandas`. [exercise1](L2FlatFilesDemo.ipynb), [exercise2](DownloadandLoadFlatFiles.ipynb)

   programmatically downloading files using `requests`: send requests to html webpage and get data. [exercise](ProgrammaticallyDownloadFiles.ipynb)

   read .txt file using `glob` into a dataframe: [exercise](L2TextFileStructure.ipynb)

   gathering data with APIs: two approaches: use HTTP GET request; use customised developer library(popular websites typically have their library to work with their API) [exercise](L2API.ipynb)

   3. Assessing Data
      
4. Cleaning Data

## Data Visulization With Matplotlib And Seaborn.
